They can also push the next and previous buttons to go to the next or previous song in the playlist, and select the stop or pause buttons to stop or pause the current song playing. 


2. Number Guessing Game Program: This program allows two iterations of a number guessing game. The first game ("guess") prompts the computer to generate a random number which the user can try to guess. The second game ("computer_guess") allows the user to guess a random number within a range which then the computer will try to guess.

5. Study Timer Program: This program allows the user to enter the amount of time in minutes they would want to study and the amount of time in minutes they would want to rest.
